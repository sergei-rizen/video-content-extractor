**Detailed Description of Key Processes:**

1. **Creating Interior Elevations:** Demonstration of the process of creating an interior elevation and observing that walls and other elements fail to populate.
2. **Troubleshooting Section Depth:** Discussion on how the depth setting of the section might be related to the issue, as elevations function like sections.
3. **Navigating Design Layers:** Guidance on navigating to the specific design layer where the elevation symbol was placed.
4. **Adjusting Scale and Position:** Demonstration of adjusting the scale and position of the elevation marker to ensure correct alignment.

**Takeaways:**

- Interior elevations are essentially sections and require proper depth settings to display correctly.
- Ensure the scale and position of elevation markers are accurate for reliable results.
- Troubleshooting architectural software often involves checking basic settings and configurations.
- Reviewing previous class materials can be helpful in resolving current challenges.
